## Conclusion

Although this project was fairly simple on the surface, it included several challenging features. First, the project provided an opportunity to learn and apply the latest version of Bootstrap. Secondly, the project was an opportunity to challenge myself in loading data and dynamically creating DOM elements and event handlers. Creating complex DOM elements and nesting them correctly within other DOM elements was challenging since the order and parent-child relationships were important. Building HTML dynamically is possible with pure JavaScript, but it is much easier in Frameworks like React where JSX is used to create the DOM elements in an intuitive way. The final website was a success and worked as desired, delivering a good user experience on a variety of devices.
