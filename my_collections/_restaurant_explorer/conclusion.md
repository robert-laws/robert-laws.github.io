## Conclusion

This project was challenging - but not too challenging. The Rails curriculum content was great to prepare me for the rails-specific aspects of the project. I felt that in this project, I was able to produce some refined rails code. I feel more and more comfortable with rails concepts like validation, scoping, helper classes and methods, and more.

The Javascript portion of the project was also challenging. When working with Javascript in the past, I found that it was easy to write long functions that did everything within the single function call. This project has helped me work on skills like refactoring code, single responsibility principle (although I wasn't 100% perfect at this), and adding meaning names and comments to my code. There are all skills I want to continue improving as I move forward.
