## Conclusion

This To Do app was a good experience for implementing several key application features that other, and often more complex, apps use all the time. Features like authentication, signup and login are used in most apps. Working with Firebase and React makes implementing an authentication process fairly straight-forward.

Other features, like routing with `react-router-dom` and updating navigation styles based on routing urls helps improve the user experience. Working in conjunction with auth state, another feature is creating protected routes to make some routes available depending on authentication state.

The app offers a fully response design by making use of Tailwind CSS to handle styling for desktop, tablet, or mobile device screens. The flexbox model for layout is used through Tailwind CSS to handle positioning and layout adjustments for different screen sizes.

Finally, features like seamless user feedback after performing actions like updates or checking on checkboxes or typing titles of new tasks and pressing return do not require page reloads. This is a key feature of React that is implemented in the app.

Some things could have been done better in this app, given more time to add features. These features include things like more robust validation on forms, an option to edit a user profile, and administrative interface for global updates, and animated UI elements.
