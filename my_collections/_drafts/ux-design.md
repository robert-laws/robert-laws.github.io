## UX Design

Since this app was simple in scope and a common type of app for developers to practice their skills, much of the UX design was uncomplicated. Things like the header, navigation, and footer were all fairly typical - left aligned logo and right aligned navigation options. The footer was also a fairly typical design, which included three center-aligned columns of navigational links, although not yet added into my wireframes.

The major area for UX design was the detail and edit pages for a To Do item. Following a somewhat typical design for to-do lists, the chosen design included a card layout with a heading text for the list title, a list of to-do items that included a checkbox for each. When a checkbox was checked, the list item would show a strike through text and a lighter color. The card also included buttons for editing and deleting. An additional element not always included in to-do lists is an additional row of keywords for each list. This was added in a separate section of the card.
