## Conclusion

The Data Viz Cafe website presented many interesting design and development challenges. It was interesting to implement a marketing-focused design that made use of text, call to action (CTA) features, illustrations, animations, and a store front component.

The website is also interesting for the educational aspects, which hopefully will help students taken the Data Visualization course in the Spring 2021.
