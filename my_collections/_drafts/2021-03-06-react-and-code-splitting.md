There are many options for creating compelling data visualizations and performing complex data analysis and reporting. [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) is in many ways the most accessible of the many tools available.<!-- more --> Tableau is different than other tools like Microsoft Power BI and Google Data Studio in that it is not integrated into a suite of other tools that come with Microsoft and Google. This is both a benefit and a limitation, but perhaps only for some particular use-cases.

Tableau can be used to create individual data visualizations, data dashboard made up of several individual data visualizations, and stories that walk a viewer through a collection of data dashboards and/or individual data visualizations. Effective presentations can be created using each of the different types of visualizations or combinations in Tableau. For data analytics, however, the data dashboard provides the most power.

The data dashboard allows the creation of complex interactivity. A developer can "hand-over" the controls to a viewer using dashboards. What this means is that filters can be set-up by the Tableau developer and a viewer will be able to apply the filters on the dashboard, reshaping the data visualizations. A powerful feature is the ability to apply more than one filter at a time on a dashboard. The result is a multi-dimensional filtering system that allows a view to slice and dice the data visualizations based on the level of detail they wish to view.

#### Tableau Help Guides

A key plus to using Tableau is the large amount of support documents they provide to help use their products. A good example of this is the their [Create Dashboards](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards.htm) section. This includes a series of different web pages detailing things like Best Practices and Accessibility. A new or experienced user can benefit from the content in each section of the many help guides.
