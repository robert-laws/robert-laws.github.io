Usability testing is an essential part of a UX design process. Unlike a defined process or step, usability testing happens throughout the UX design process.<!-- more --> During early stages of a UX design process, especially for a new website, usability testing involves talking with users about what they want from a website. Further down the road, when wireframes and prototypes are developed, users can give feedback on the flow of the website or it's structure. Finally, when a website is launched, or when beginning a redesign process with an existing website, usability testing can shed light on how users successfully, or unsuccessfully, interact with a working website.

## User-centered Research

#### Focus-groups, Interviews, Surveys

Before having a user interact with a website or device, it's often very helpful to sit down with users and discuss what they want to get from a website. Whether it be an e-commerce website, a governmental services website, or a university library website, users access each for specific reasons and have ideas about what they want to find on each. Speaking with users about their wants, desires, and goals is very important.

The form of speaking with users can take on several different forms including interviews with individual users, focus groups with several users at once, or surveys that users fill out. Such surveys can include open-ended questions that allow users to provide feedback outside of the usually structured survey question.

The result of this process is data. Sometimes quantitative, but often qualitative in nature, this user data can be organized and analyzed. The information that can be produced through user research at this stage in the UX Design process help to inform progressive stages of the process.

## UX Design

#### Personas

After gathering a good amount of qualitative data during the user research process, it's time to put that information to use. An important piece of information for developing a website is who are the most likely users of the website and what characteristics do they all have in common?

#### User Goals/Stories

#### Empathy Mapping

#### Affinity Diagrams

#### Card Sorting

[Card sorting](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html) is an activity to understand site and/or page structure or labeling and categorization. Users can be asked to perform a card sort. This is done by giving a user a stack of cards that correspond to important pages or segments of a website and asking the user how they think the cards should be group and/or organized.

#### Flows (Task, Wire, User)

#### Wireframes

#### Prototypes

## Usability Testing

#### Observation

#### Scenario-based Testing
