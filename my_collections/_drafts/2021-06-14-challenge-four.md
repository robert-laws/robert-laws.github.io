The fourth challenge in the UX/HTML/CSS Design and Code Challenge series is a travel blog website. This challenge continues to explore CSS Grid layout and adds support for responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop versions.<!-- more --> The inspiration for this challenge comes from the website [Traveling Mitch](https://www.travelingmitch.com/), which documents the authors travel experiences.

The challenge, like challenges [one](https://robert-laws.com/blog/challenge-one), [two](https://robert-laws.com/blog/challenge-two), and [three](https://robert-laws.com/blog/challenge-three) is to recreate the design of the website homepage ([live version of the final website for challenge four](https://www.robert-developer.com/challenges/four/)). The focus of this challenge is on responsive design. This challenge also builds upon previous challenge concepts, particularly CSS Grid.
