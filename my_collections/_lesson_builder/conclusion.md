## Conclusion

The Lesson Builder website is simple, but showcases several interesting technologies used in conjunction with each other. A common approach to developing data-driven websites is to create a separate front-end for presentation and a back-end for data storage. Using WordPress as the data store and React as the presentation layer, connected through the WordPress REST API, is an effective combination of technologies. JWT is also a powerful tool for authentication, but also approachable for developers since the concept behind it is straight-forward. Finally, since modern websites often include interesting interactive elements, it's nice to be able to add functionality like drag and drop that works well within the React and WordPress REST API ecosystem.
