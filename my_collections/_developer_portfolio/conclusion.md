## Conclusion

The Developer Portfolio project was a great opportunity to learn the Jekyll technology and structure a website to promote my developer skills and knowledge. The things that were successful were making use of the power of Jekyll particularly for blog post creation and structuring project content. Jekyll also supports includes, which is an essential aspect of templating a website, which is a huge enhancement to developer efficiency.

The aspects of the project that I would revisit is not taking a mobile-first approach in development. What I learned is that it's easier to begin with the mobile version and expand it into a desktop version rather than the reverse.

Overall, the website is a success and has allowed me to hone my skills, particularly in areas like Flexbox, Sass, the BEM methodology, and Liquid syntax. There's room for improvement, but a good result for version 1.0.
