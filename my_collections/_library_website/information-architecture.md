## Information Architecture

The website's overall information architecture is not complex. From the home page there are no other pages that are linked deeper than one level. This allows for a simple structure that consists of five categories - research, guides, services, forms, and about - for all website content. The website does not make use of any external databases or data - and performs as a static site.
