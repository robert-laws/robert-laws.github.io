## Information Architecture

The website information architecture is not complex. It consists of a home page with single level children pages. The store front portion of the website is made up of informational pages for the shop locations and the menu listings. There are also pages for placing an order, reviewing data, and viewing data visualizations. The course instruction portion of the website consists of a separate page for each of the 5 weeks of instruction and pages listing data visualization resources and key concepts and definitions. Finally, there's an About page.

The back end requirements are mostly related to the store front portion of the website. When placing an order, there are logical connections between the shop locations, menu items, and creating an order. The order submission references key values for locations and menu items. However, this isn't based on a database running in the background. The data is stored locally as `json` files.
