## Conclusion

This project included several interesting challenges. There was the challenge of designing and developing an interactive user interface that allowed users to drag and drop instructional modules to build a instructional class. There was also the challenge of writing data to a JSON object and sending an email upon submission of the built class.

Other challenges included gaining a better understanding of user needs and attempting to work through a UX design process to work through different ways to imagine and visualize how to best accommodate different user needs. Although this challenge was different from writing code, it was just as important to spend sufficient time to solve.

Ultimately, the goal of the site was to better inform users - university faculty in the case of this site - of the options and details available to them in the form of library instruction available. Another goal was to help library staff to organize and better explain the instruction services being offered. There is still room for improvement with the site, but the main goal of the site was successful. University faculty were able to create a customized instructional session, save their selections, and inform the library of their request for the instruction by using only the website.
