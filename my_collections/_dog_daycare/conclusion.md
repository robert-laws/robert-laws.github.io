## Conclusion

This project was great experience with the Ruby on Rails web framework - making use of important MVC (Model - View - Controller) concepts. The project also allowed me to explore user interface design. Overall, I was pleased with how the project came together to create an interactive website. In further development, I would definitely improve on the reservation user experience - allowing users to select using a calendar object instead of drop-down lists.
