## Introduction

#### Purpose / Vision

A website that allows dog owners to find a dog daycare center, select dates and make reservations, and choose from a range of activities available to entertain the dog during their stay.

#### Overview

Users create an account with their personal and dog information. Once they create their account and authenticate, users are able to make a reservation on a specific date and select what activities their dog should have during the day. Users submit their selections and receive confirmation. A separate administration section allows an admin user to add locations, dates available, and activities available that users can then select.
