## Content Development

The content for the website consists of educational-focused information. On the website, students and visitors can learn about data visualization and how to use software like Tableau to create them. Users can gain access to many different external resources as well. The website also aims to help students test their knowledge of data visualization through quizzes. Finally, students fill out poll questions each week, which are then visualized, along their their quiz results, on the dashboard page.
