## UX Design

The design for the website focused on simplicity of layout and clarity of the content. To this end, the website only included a header, a footer, and a main content area. The design focus was placed more on content and usability. Forms used for the signup, login, quiz, and polls emphasized a clean layout and attractive UI elements. Other aspects of the design included the color palette and the typography. The color palette aimed to be modern and have a futuristic feel. The typography used only one font - [Poppins from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) - for headings and body text with the aim of creating a modern feel and maximizing readability.
