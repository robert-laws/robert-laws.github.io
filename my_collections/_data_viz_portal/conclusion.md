## Conclusion

This project was challenging in many ways. The website requires users to create accounts and login to the website to perform functions like taking polls and quizzes. It's necessary to track the user and write to the Firestore database data that is logically linked to the user. The website also requires retrieval and processing of data to display as desired in various data visualizations used in the website. React offered a good solution to these problems and allowed the website to be both functional and performant at the same time.
