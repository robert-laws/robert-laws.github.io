## Information Architecture

The website's information architecture has several top-level pages and a small number of nested page sections. At the top level are the home page, the knowledge-base page, the login, and the signup pages. Each of these pages is accessible without needing to be logged into the website. Once a user has logged in they will have access to a profile and dashboard page, which displays personalized information. They also can view and take quizzes and polls, which are sub-sections to the quiz and poll pages.

The knowledge-base page contains information that is sub-divided into four separate tab views. Users are able to select a different tab and load the content for that tab within the page. The knowledge-base page contains a range of different content including embedded videos and a data visualization from [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/c).
