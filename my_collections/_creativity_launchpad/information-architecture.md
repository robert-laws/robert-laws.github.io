## Information Architecture

The information architecture of the website aims to reduce the number of pages and concentrate on the most important information to the user. Since the UX research showed that users want to spend more time exploring resources and viewing examples of how they can be used in projects, the information architecture prioritizes this goal in the website structure.

The following information architecture was proposed for the website:

- Home Page
  - All resources with links to individual resources
  - All projects with links to individual projects
  - All articles with links to individual articles
  - About the website page

The individual resource pages will includes links to the project pages based on projects that utilize a particular resource. Likewise, the individual project pages also will include links back to resource pages based on the resources used in a particular project. The inter-connectivity of the different parts of the website reflects the emphasis on the connection between resources and projects, vice versa.
