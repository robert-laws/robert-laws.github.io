## Content Development

One of the most challenging aspects of the project was the content development. The website would require content for individual resources - like cameras, microphones, software, etc. Each resource would include descriptive information about the resource as well as in which projects it could be used. The content development for resource and projects was built upon the information architecture definitions for the website and incorporated the interconnections between resources and projects in the content development. The result was that each resource needed to include as list of projects that made use of a controlled vocabulary of projects. In this way, the information architecture of the website was used to develop the data structures for the content development.

The result was a linkage between projects and resources. Each resource could be used in one or more projects. Articles, on the other hand, would not have any relationships with either resources or projects as reflected in their data structures.

Each resource, project, and article would also make use of one or more images. The images were primarily found on the websites [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), which are great resources of royalty-free stock photos.
