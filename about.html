      <p>Since 1999, I've been developing websites - primarily for educational institutions, like libraries. Of course
        this means that I began learning and putting into practice web development skills from the era of Netscape
        Navigator and Javascript as a toy programming language. </p>

      <p>A lot has changed since that time. Similar to many aspiring web developers, I've taken a circuitous path to
        becoming a web developer. When entered university in 1994, I had experience with the Macintosh Class II from
        high school, but little else. I was introduced to the Pine email client and the Mosaic web browser upon
        beginning my university career at George Mason in 1994. It was at this time that I took a detour to pursue the
        study of history, which ultimately resulted in a BA and MA degree. I was fortunate to work as a graduate
        assistant in a forward-thinking library department at George Mason where I developed basic informational web
        pages. I also was fortunate to take a course in graduate school taught by professor Roy Rosenzweig who
        introduced me to the concept of Digital History and the power of technology and information in his course Clio
        Wired.</p>

        <h5>Quick Facts</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Coding since 1999</li>
          <li>Used Netscape Navigator to make 1st webpage</li>
          <li>First OOP Language - C#</li>
          <li>Currently using Javascript most</li>
          <li>Huge fan of Sass</li>
        </ul>
      </aside>
      <p>Having been exposed to the world-changing technologies that were still in their early stages in 1999, I grew
        more interested in web technologies and their growing impact. I also began learning more about early UI/UX
        concepts including the advent of Flash as an multimedia delivery system. After graduating from SUNY at Buffalo
        with a degree in Library and Information Science, I was able to further advance my skills in web development
        and was introduced to the .NET Framework and Object-Oriented Programming by creating a data-driven web
        application for the library.</p>
      <h4>Technology and Books</h4>
      <p>Moving on from here, I arrived at Georgetown University in Washington DC and immediately became involved in
        advising and developing data structures for the library archives as well as enhancing the library catalog DOM
        with Javascript. It was during this time I felt like I had true command Javascript to parse and manipulate the
        UI through iteration and DOM parsing.</p>
      <h4>Overseas Adventures</h4>
      <p>An opportunity came up in the Fall of 2007 for me to move to Qatar and work for Georgetown University's campus
        overseas. Moving to Qatar, I got to experience life as an expatriot and acted as a department of one for the
        online presence of the Qatar campus library. I was able to lead multiple projects to redesign the library
        website, always looking to incorporate new technologies. Some examples of the technologies I explored and
        implemented are Jquery, JSON, CSS Frameworks, Drupal, and MVC architecture using AngularJS.</p>

      <p>I'm excited for the future in web development. Technology advancements press forward and will impact the world
        of web development for the foreseeable future. Data network speeds continue to increase, allowing for fully
        streamable media content without the need to download presistent copies. Highly reactive websites improve the
        user experience and give web developers access to tools that can unleash their creativity and ambitions.</p>
      <h4>Rapid Developments</h4>
      <p>That brings me to the present moment. I continue to explore the latest technologies and have lead classes or
        workshops on modern web development processes using task and package managers. Currently, I'm working with the
        latest technologies - Webpack, React, AngularJS, Vue, and ASP.NET Core MVC.</p>
      <p>Although I've worked in libraries for most of my career, my future path is with full-on web development. As
        the world changes, I believe it will be essential to have high-level technical skills to keep up. </p>
      <blockquote>The key to success in the 21st century is embracing and using technology.<i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i><span
          class="author"> <em>Robert Laws</em></span></blockquote>
      <p>For institutions and professions that aren't willing to embrace the changes, they will find it harder to make
        themselves relevant in the 21st century.</p>
      <h4>Interests Outside of Web Development</h4>
      <p>Most of my waking hours are spent at a computer screen working with web technologies. However, during the
        hours when I'm not staring at a screen I'm either enjoying a run outside, traveling, taking photos, or spending
        time with my two dogs - Snowflake and Flurry.</p>
      <p>I've been fortunate to have traveled widely throughout Europe. I particularly enjoyed visiting Germany, which
        has all the charms of the Old World, yet is a very modern and technologically advanced country. Many of my best
        photographs have been taken during my time visiting Germany.</p>
