        Since 1995, I've been working in libraries, first as a student worker, a
        graduate assistant, and in several professional positions. I've also
        been developing websites and online content since 1999. My upbringing
        and career have been infused with technology. Beginning with the Pine
        email client and Netscape Navigator in the mid-1990s, I've been using
        modern IT tools as they began to evolve into what they are today.

        A lot has changed since the mid-1990s. However, libraries have been one
        of the few places that fully embraced new and emerging technologies from
        their inception. Libraries adopted platforms such as CD-Rom-based
        content databases and technology supporting the Online Public Access
        Catalog (OPAC) for several decades, and have been open to taking
        advantage of the potential to improve services and user experiences
        offered by technology. It's the excitement and promise of technology in
        libraries that caught my attention.

        I was fortunate to work as a graduate assistant in a forward-thinking
        library department at George Mason where I developed basic informational
        web pages. I also was fortunate to take a course in graduate school
        taught by professor Roy Rosenzweig who introduced me to the concept of
        Digital History and the power of technology and information in his
        course Clio Wired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having been exposed to the world-changing technologies that were still
        in their early stages in 1999, I grew more interested in web
        technologies and their growing impact. I also began learning more about
        early UI/UX concepts including the advent of Flash as an multimedia
        delivery system. After graduating from SUNY at Buffalo with a degree in
        Library and Information Science, I was able to further advance my skills
        in web development and was introduced to the .NET Framework and
        Object-Oriented Programming by creating a data-driven web application
        for the library.
      </p>
      <h4>Technology and Books</h4>
      <p>
        Moving on from here, I arrived at Georgetown University in Washington DC
        and immediately became involved in advising and developing data
        structures for the library archives, learning a lot about Encoded
        Archival Description (EAD) metadata standards. I also spent a good
        amount of time helping to enhance the user interface for the library
        catalog with Javascript. It was during this time I felt like I had a
        genuine understanding of Javascript and some of the core concepts behind
        many programming languages. It was exciting to work on a campus with
        thousands of students and researchers doing important work that depended
        heavily upon library resources and support for their success. The
        contributions I made to the online catalog played a small, but at the
        time an important step in the path of my career.
      </p>
      <h4>Overseas Adventures</h4>
      <p>
        An opportunity came up in the Fall of 2007 for me to move to Qatar and
        work for Georgetown University's campus overseas. Moving to Qatar, I got
        to experience life as an ex-patriot and acted as a department of one for
        the online presence of the Qatar campus library. I was able to lead
        multiple projects to redesign the library website, always looking to
        incorporate new technologies. Some examples of the technologies I
        explored and implemented are Jquery, JSON, CSS Frameworks, Drupal,
        WordPress and modern web development frameworks with AngularJS and
        React.

        I also have greatly broadened my instructional skills and the many other
        soft skills that often go hand-in-hand with teaching. My instructional
        experience ranges from traditional information literacy sessions, to
        stand-alone courses on a wide array of technical topics, to a
        credit-bearing undergraduate course on Data Visualization that combines
        core concepts like data analysis, how to make persuasive arguments, and
        visual design with software instruction with Tableau.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm excited for the future in librarianship and web development.
        Technology advancements continue to move forward and will impact
        libraries for the foreseeable future. Changes like even-increasing
        network speeds will allow for fully stream-able media without the need
        to download local copies. Highly reactive websites will continue to
        improve the user experience and give web developers access to tools that
        can unleash their creativity and ambitions.
      </p>
      <h4>Trying to Keep Up with Change</h4>
      <p>
        That brings me to the present moment. I continue to explore the latest
        technologies and have lead classes or workshops on new software and
        modern web development. Currently, I'm exploring many different types of
        educational technologies and creating web experiences to augment the
        learning experience for students.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        For libraries, as well as many institutions and professions, it's
        necessary to keep up with the rapid changes introduced by technology to
        remain relevant in the 21st century.

      <h4>Interests Outside of Web Development</h4>
      <p>
        Most of my waking hours are spent at a computer screen working with web
        technologies. However, during the hours when I'm not staring at a screen
        I'm either enjoying a run outside, traveling, taking photos, or spending
        time with my two dogs - Snowflake and Flurry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been fortunate to have traveled widely throughout Europe. I
        particularly enjoyed visiting Germany, which has all the charms of the
        Old World, yet is a very modern and technologically advanced country.
        Many of my best photographs have been taken during my time visiting
        Germany.
